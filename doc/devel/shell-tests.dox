/**
 @page shellTests Shell Tests

There is a certain small number of shell unit-tests. Those tests are located
in tests/shell directory. They use the same framework as Kea
(http://kea.isc.org), ISC's new DHCP server software. Shell tests
currently cover two features: ability of the dhclient to call external
script when certain events happen; and the proper behavior of linux
script.

The tests use a framework that is defined in tests/shell/dhcp_test_lib.sh.
It offers a number of utility functions, like pretty printing start and
end of a test, waiting for a message to appear in file, terminate process etc.

It is envisaged that each component will have its own tests written in a
separate file. Two examples are dhclient_tests.sh (that tests dhclient) and
linux_script_tests.sh (which test a script intended to be used on Linux). An
example minimal skeleton file is available in example_tests.sh. It contains
one passing, one skipping and one failing test.

To run unit-tests, use the following commands:

@verbatim
cd tests
make check
@endverbatim

If you want to add extra tests, please add your unit-tests to SHTESTS in
tests/Makefile.am file.
